# Analog Devices Gyro Board for FIRST Robotics### A simple breakout board for the ADXRS450/ADXRS453 gyroscope!
This repository is meant to document the development of the ADXRS450/453 donation board built by Analog Devices Inc. and donated to FIRST Robotics teams. The gyro board incorporates a calibrated, single-axis yaw-rate sensor typically used in industrial and navigation applications.
