# Analog Devices Gyro Board for FIRST Robotics
### A simple breakout board for interfacing the ADXRS450/ADXRS453 gyroscope with an FRC RoboRIO!

This repository is meant to document the development of the ADXRS450/453 donation board built by Analog Devices Inc. and donated to FIRST Robotics Competition teams. The gyro board incorporates a calibrated, single-axis yaw-rate sensor typically used in industrial and navigation applications.

### ADXRS450 Features:

- Complete rate gyroscope on a single chip
- ±300°/sec angular rate sensing (single axis Z)
- High vibration rejection over a wide frequency range
- Excellent 25°/hour null offset stability
- Internally temperature compensated
- 2000 g powered shock survivability
- SPI digital output with 16-bit data-word
- Low noise and low power
- 3.3 V and 5 V operation
- -40°C to +105°C operation
- Ultra-small, light, and RoHS compliant

### Gyro Board Features:

- Designed to easily interface with the SPI port on the RoboRIO
- Software support is built into the official WPILib software distribution 
- Java, C++, and LabVIEW are fully supported
- *New in 2019* - SPI CS solder jumper for compatibility with other SPI devices on the same bus
